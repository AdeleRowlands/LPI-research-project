# LPI-research-project
A master's course project aiming to expand the Living Planet Index (LPI) database with species population trends from the IUCN Red List. From this new LPI database, the LPI can be recalculated.

The first step is to learn how to use Githut so that I can share my R-scripts with my supervisors. These R-scripts will consist of code which will compare the LPI database with the IUCN Red List database. It will identify which species are present in the either or both databases and for those species that are present in the IUCN database and not the Red List database it will extract information about which criterion was used to classify that that species' extinction risk and the data that led to this classification.
