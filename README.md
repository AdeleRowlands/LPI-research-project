# LPI-research-project
A master's course project aiming to expand the Living Planet Index (LPI) database with species population trends from the IUCN Red List. From this new LPI database, the LPI can be recalculated.

The first step is to compare the LPI database with the IUCN Red List database. I will identify which species are present in the either or both databases and for those species that are present in the IUCN database and not the Red List database i will extract information about which criterion was used to classify that that species' extinction risk and the data that led to this classification.
